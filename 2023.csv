SLSA,Trial,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>As software continues to grow in complexity, the threat vector of software dependencies becomes increasingly challenging to guard against. Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts, or <strong><a href=""https://slsa.dev/"">SLSA</a></strong> (pronounced ""salsa""), is a consortium-curated set of guidance for organizations to protect against supply chain attacks, evolved from internal guidance Google has been using for years. We appreciate that SLSA doesn't promise a ""silver bullet,"" tools-only approach to securing the supply chain, but it does provide a checklist of concrete threats and practices along a maturity model. The <a href=""https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/threats"">threat model</a> is easy to follow with real-world examples of attacks, and the <a href=""https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements"">requirements</a> provide guidance to help organizations prioritize actions based on levels of increasing robustness to improve their supply chain security posture. Since we first mentioned it in the Radar, SLSA has added more detail around <a href=""https://slsa.dev/attestation-model"">software attestations</a> with examples to track concerns like <a href=""https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2"">build provenance</a>. Our teams have found SLSA to strike a nice balance between implementation guidance and higher-level awareness around supply chain threats.</p>"
Software Bill of Materials,Trial,Techniques,FALSE,"<p>With continued pressure to keep systems secure and no reduction in the general threat landscape, a machine-readable <strong>Software Bill of Materials</strong> (SBOM) may help teams stay on top of security problems in the libraries that they rely on. Since the original <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/"">Executive Order</a> was published, the industry has gained clarity and understanding of what an SBOM is and how to create one; the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), for example, now has more <a href=""https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity/software-security-supply-chains-software-1"">specific advice</a> on how to comply with the order. We've had production experience using SBOMs on projects ranging from small companies to large multinationals and even government departments, and we're convinced they provide a benefit. More organizations and governments should consider requiring SBOMs for the software they use. The technique will be strengthened by the new tools that continue to emerge, such as the <a href=""https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/learn-more#bom"">Firebase Android BOM</a> that automatically aligns an application's library dependencies to those listed in the BOM.</p>"
Retool,Trial,Platforms,FALSE,"<p>In previous editions, we’ve recommended assessing <a href=""/radar/techniques/bounded-low-code-platforms"">bounded low-code platforms</a> as a method for applying low-code solutions to specific use cases in very limited domains. We’ve seen some traction in this space, specifically with <a href=""https://retool.com/""><strong>Retool</strong></a>, a low-code platform that our teams use to build solutions for internal users, predominantly to query and visualize data. It allows them to produce non-business-critical read-only solutions faster. The main reported benefits of Retool are its UI components and its ability to be integrated quickly and easily with common data sources.</p>"
Swift Package Manager,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,"<p>When introduced in 2014, Swift didn't come with a package manager. Later, <strong><a href=""https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager"">Swift Package Manager</a></strong> was created as an official Apple open-source project, and this solution has continued to develop and mature. Our teams rely increasingly on SwiftPM because most packages can be included through it and the processes for both creators and consumers of packages have been streamlined. In the previous Radar, we recommended trialing, but we now believe it makes sense to select it as the default when starting new projects. For existing projects using tools like CocoaPods or <a href=""/radar/tools/carthage"">Carthage</a>, it might be worth a quick experiment to gauge the level of effort to migrate and to check whether all dependencies are available.</p>"
PostgreSQL AWS RDS,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"<p><a href=""https://www.postgresql.org/about/"">PostgreSQL</a> is the default, standard database of choice here at Vibes, used widely across most teams. It is a powerful object relational database with decades of active development. It can be used for traditional relational (SQL) use cases as well as for non-relational needs (NoSQL) and can be configured to operate in a geographically distributed environment with bidirectional replication. Aligned with our principle of ""Build Differentiators"", we run PostgreSQL on AWS RDS instead of standalone to reduce the operational and administrative burden.</p>"
AWS ElastiCache (Redis),Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"Used widely across Platform and Connect for caching and, in some cases, as an in-memory database. Any standalone/self-hosted instances of Redis have been/are being migrated to ElastiCache, aligned with our architecture principle of Cloud Native."
Confluent Cloud,Adopt,Platforms,FALSE,"Confluent Cloud provides a managed Apache Kafka service in addition to value added services such as managed connectors and KSQL. Kafka differs in its approach to messaging by building on the concept of an append-only log oriented towards streaming use cases. This architecture enables access to stream history, which can be valuable for certain use cases. Please refer to <a href=""#"">this guide</a> for guidance on when to choose Kafka over other messaging platforms. "
Python,Adopt,languages-and-frameworks,FALSE,"Python is a general purpose programming language that is over 30 years old.

AWS Cloudformation,Hold,Tools,FALSE,"Cloudformation is a managed infrastructure-as-code service. In almost all cases, we prefer Terraform for infrastructure management and automation, but there are some use cases (stacksets) for which CloudFormation is a better tool (e.g., automatically deploying security policies and configurations to new accounts)."
CAS,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on protocol for web applications. CAS is at the heart of Vibes Security Services providing authentication for applications and API's. The CAS protocol is currently implemented through the CASino Rails/Ruby engine, with some customizations made through the years. We would like to retire this service but do not have any near term work on the roadmap to do so. Teams should continue to use Security Services for authentication and authorization needs and the use of CAS should be fairly opaque to consumers."
